    description: "The Linux Cluster Monitoring Project is aimed at supporting the Business Systems Analysis (BSA) work, focusing on the 
      elicitation and analysis of requirements from stakeholders. In this context, the BSA plays a crucial role in drafting the Business 
      Requirements Document (BRD) and System Requirements Document (SRD), ensuring that the project aligns with the stakeholders' needs. 
      Through detailed requirement analysis, the project emphasizes the importance of RDBMS and SQL for efficient data management and 
      modeling. The project's design allows network and system administrators to monitor hardware specifications and memory usage, using 
      technologies like Docker, PostgreSQL, and shell scripts. In the BSA context, establishing Service Level Agreements (SLA) is vital to 
      maintain the performance and reliability of the monitoring system, ensuring that the project meets the predefined standards and 
      expectations of the stakeholders."

    description: "Developed a traffic sign recognition system utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), renowned for its effectiveness 
      in image analysis. Selected a comprehensive dataset from the Kaggle website, comprising nearly 50,000 images of traffic signs for 
      training and testing purposes. Upon completion of the model's training phase, it demonstrated a remarkable 96% accuracy rate, 
      underscoring its capability to reliably identify traffic signs."

    #git_url:
    description: "Constructed a language detection system utilizing the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) methodology to accurately classify the 
      language of any given text. This system was trained on a Kaggle dataset featuring 17-18 unique languages, each represented by at 
      least 1000 lines of text. Through the application and evaluation of various algorithms, it was highlighted that the MNB approach 
      outperformed others, achieving the highest accuracy rate of 95%."
