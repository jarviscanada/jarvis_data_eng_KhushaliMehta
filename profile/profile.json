This system was trained on a Kaggle dataset featuring 17-18 unique languages, each represented by at least 1000 lines of text. Through the application and evaluation of various algorithms, it was highlighted that the MNB approach outperformed others, achieving the highest accuracy rate of 95%.",

      "description": "The Linux Cluster Monitoring Project is aimed at supporting the Business Systems Analysis (BSA) work, focusing on the elicitation and analysis of requirements from stakeholders. In this context, the BSA plays a crucial role in drafting the Business Requirements Document (BRD) and System Requirements Document (SRD), ensuring that the project aligns with the stakeholders' needs. Through detailed requirement analysis, the project emphasizes the importance of RDBMS and SQL for efficient data management and modeling. The project's design allows network and system administrators to monitor hardware specifications and memory usage, using technologies like Docker, PostgreSQL, and shell scripts. In the BSA context, establishing Service Level Agreements (SLA) is vital to maintain the performance and reliability of the monitoring system, ensuring that the project meets the predefined standards and expectations of the stakeholders.",
